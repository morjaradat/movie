        <p id="first-p" >John Wick (retroactively known as John Wick: Chapter 1) is a 2014 American neo-noir action-thriller film
            directed by Chad Stahelski, in his directorial debut, and written by Derek Kolstad. It stars Keanu Reeves,
            Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo,
            and Willem Dafoe. It is the first installment in the John Wick film series.</p>
        <p > The story focuses on John Wick (Reeves) searching for the men who broke into his home, stole his vintage car
            and killed his puppy, which was a last gift to him from his recently deceased wife.[6] Chad Stahelski and
            David Leitch directed the film together, though only Stahelski was credited.[1]</p>
        <p >Kolstad had completed the screenplay in 2012 and further developed it for Thunder Road Pictures.[7] The film
            was produced by Basil Iwanyk of Thunder Road Pictures, Leitch, Eva Longoria, and Michael Witherill. It marks
            Stahelski and Leitch's directorial debut as a team after multiple separate credits as second-unit directors
            and stunt coordinators. They previously worked with Reeves as stunt doubles on The Matrix trilogy.[8]</p>
